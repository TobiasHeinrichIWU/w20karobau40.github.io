  A project site and blog.

# quote from the gitlab documentation:
# For example, for a Jekyll site, the baseurl is defined in the Jekyll configuration file, _config.yml.
# If your website URL is https://john.gitlab.io/blog/, you need to add this line to _config.yml: baseurl: "/blog"
baseurl: "/visualisierung-karobau40"
