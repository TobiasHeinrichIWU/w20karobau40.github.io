Hardly any other industry is more affected by the topic of Industry 4.0 than the automotive industry, and this applies equally to both its products and their production. German companies have a leading global position here, which must be defended and, at best, expanded. Suppliers, equipment manufacturers and service providers in particular must rise to the challenges in order to sustainably meet the demands of a changing market in the future. But where is the journey heading in concrete terms? And how can companies prepare themselves in the best possible way?

The objective of this project is to record and analyze the upcoming changes in automotive production due to digitalization, shortage of skilled workers and electromobility and to develop a strategic perspective.

To investigate these issues of automotive car body construction, Fraunhofer IWU is conducting a Germany-wide study on "Car Body Construction of the Future", for which a broad range of participants has been recruited.
The initial data collection involved answering an online questionnaire and a subsequent expert interview. Here, the areas of megatrends, technologies, future trends and support offerings were considered in order to gain a deeper insight into

- current and future requirements of the car body shop,

- necessary future technologies, 

- the current implementation status of digitization strategies and 

- Possibilities for coping with the requirements.

This study will be continued as planned beyond the end of the project in order to continuously identify trends at an early stage and to identify development needs. Take part in our survey and compare your view of the car body shop of the future with that of your colleagues, partners and competitors. As the results dynamically adapt to new answers, it is worth taking a regular look at the charts to identify future trend reversals in good time.

This measure is co-financed with tax funds on the basis of the budget passed by the Saxon state parliament.
