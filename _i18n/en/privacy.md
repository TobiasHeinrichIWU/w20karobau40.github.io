### <a name="3.">3. Personal Data Processing and Purposes of Data Processing</a>
__a) When visiting the website__

You may access our website without having to disclose any details on your identity. The browser installed on your device merely transmits information automatically to the server of our website (e.g., browser type and version, date and time of access) to enable a connection with the website. This includes the IP address of your requesting device. This information is temporarily stored in a so-called log file and will be deleted after 30 Tage.

Your IP address is processed for technical and administrative purposes regarding connection set-up and stability, to guarantee the security and functioning of our website and, if necessary, to be able to track any illegal attacks on the website.

The legal basis for processing the IP address is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest ensues from said security interest and the necessity of the unobstructed availability of our website.

We cannot draw any direct conclusions about your identity from processing the IP address and other information in the log file.

Moreover, we use cookies and analytics services when you visit our website. Further details can be found below in this data protection information.

__b) When using contact forms__

Our website gives visitors the opportunity to post comments on our articles and blog posts. Your comments will appear with your name below the article/post you are commenting on.

If you want to use the comment function on our website, we ask you to provide the following mandatory data:
- Name and  
- Email address
  
Instead of your name, you may use a pseudonym/alias. The process requires that you provide your email address to send your comment. However, we do not publish your email address together with your comment. We use your email address only to inform you of a reaction to your comment.

In addition, when you post a comment on our website, we store your IP address, which we will delete after 30 Tage. This storage period is required so that we can defend ourselves against liability claims in case of publication of possibly illegal content.

The processing of data is in response to your comments and is justified in the context of publishing online contributions together with user reactions and on the basis of our legitimate interest in an opinion and information exchange pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.

The personal data are processed for as long as the comment is published on the website and are then deleted.

### <a name="4.">4. Transfer of Data</a>

If we transfer personal data collected through websites to processors, we will notify you in this data protection information regarding the respective data processing operation, citing the specific recipient.

Aside from that, we will transfer your personal data only if
- you have given explicit consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR;  
- this is necessary pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. b GDPR for the performance of a contract with you (for example, transfer to shipping companies for the purpose of delivering goods ordered by you, or transmitting payment information to payment service providers or credit institutions in order to process a payment transaction);  
- there is a legal obligation for transfer pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR.
  
The recipients must not use the transferred data for any purposes other than the above-mentioned ones.

### <a name="5.">5. Cookies</a>

__General__

This website uses cookies. Cookies are small files that your browser automatically generates and stores on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site. Cookies do not harm your device nor do they contain viruses, Trojans or other malware.

Cookies store information associated with the specific device used. That does not mean that we can directly identify you..	 	 	 	 	 
Cookies that are not absolutely technically necessary for you to use a web service expressly requested by you are only set after you have consented. You can give this consent via the cookie banner that is displayed when you visit the website. This consent then becomes the legal basis for the storage of and access to the content of the cookies (Sec. 15 (3) TMG in conjunction with Art. 5 (3) clause 1 of Directive 2002/58/EC).

__Necessary cookies__

The processing of personal data in the context of technically necessary cookies is based on our legitimate interest in providing our web services that you have expressly requested (Art. 6 (1) clause 1 lit. f GDPR, if applicable in conjunction with Art. 95 GDPR, Art. 5 (3) of Directive 2002/58/EC).

For example, we use so-called session cookies to allow session controls or to store data entries in forms or shopping carts during the session. Session cookies are deleted no later than when you close your browser.

__Right of withdrawal__

You may revoke your consent to the storage of and access to the content of the cookies at any time with effect for the future pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR or object to the use in whole or in part of cookies that are not technically necessary.

If you revoke your consent or object to the use, we will set a cookie (an opt-out cookie) that documents your decision and allows us to implement it. The opt-out cookie works only in this browser and only for our website. It is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you will have to set the opt-out cookie again.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can configure your browser to not store any cookies on your computer or to display a notice before new cookies are set. Completely disabling cookies may mean that you cannot make full use of all functions of our website.

Your revocation has no effect on the lawfulness of the processing activities we perform on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) clause 1 lit. f) GDPR).

### <a name="6.">6. Social Media Plug-ins</a>
We use so-called social media buttons (also called social media plug-ins) on our website. These are small icons you can use to publish contents from our website on social networks under your own profile.

If you activate such an icon, a connection is established between our website and the social network. In addition to the contents in question, the operator of the social network obtains further, in part also personal information. For example, this includes the fact that you are currently visiting our site.

The social media buttons are integrated using the so-called Shariff solution. This solution prevents your device from establishing a link to the social network merely because you visit a website featuring a social media plug-in button without you having clicked on that button. This means that information is only transmitted to the social network when you activate the button.

We integrate the following social plug-ins on our website:

__a)	Facebook Ireland Limited: Sharing on Facebook__

In part, information is transmitted to the parent company Facebook Inc., headquartered in the USA, to other Facebook-companies and external partners of Facebook, each of which may be located outside the European Union.

__Information on your right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDP__

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. e GDPR (data processing carried out in the public interest) and Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (data processing for purposes of legitimate interests). This also applies to any profiling as defined in Art. 4 (4) GDPR that is based on said provision in Art. 6. 

If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

If your objection is directed against the processing of data for the purpose of direct advertising, we will stop the processing immediately. In this case, citing a special situation is not necessary. This includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct advertising.

If you would like to assert your right to object, simply send an email to [datenschutzkoordination@zv.fraunhofer.de](mailto:datenschutzkoordination@zv.fraunhofer.de).

### <a name="8.">8. Data Security</a>

All your personal data are transmitted in encrypted format, using the widely used and secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) standard. TLS is a secure and proven standard that is also used, for instance, in online banking. You will recognize a secure TLS connection by the additional s after http (i.e., https://...) in the address bar of your browser or by the lock icon in the bottom part of your browser window.

In all other regards, we use suitable technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulations, partial or complete loss, destruction, or the unauthorized access of third parties. We continuously improve our security measures in accordance with the state of the art.
