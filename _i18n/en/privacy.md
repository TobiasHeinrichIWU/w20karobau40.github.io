__a) When visiting the website__

You may access the website www.fraunhofer.de without having to disclose any details of your identity. What the browser on your terminal device does automatically is only to send information to the server of our website (e.g. browser type and version, date and time of access) so as to allow a connection with the website. This also includes the IP address of your requesting terminal device. It is temporarily stored in a so-called log file and automatically deleted after XX days.

**(Anm Hara: hier nochmal Auswahl dieser Satz oder nachfolgender Block; je nach Nutzung)
[Die Speicherung der IP-Adresse erfolgt anonymisiert indem der letzte Zeichenblock entfernt wird].  
The IP address is processed for technical and administrative purposes regarding connection set-up and stability, to guarantee the security and functioning of our website and to be able to track any illegal attacks on the website, if required.

The legal basis for processing the IP address is the first sentence of point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest ensues from said security interest and the necessity of the unobstructed availability of our website.

We cannot draw any direct conclusions about your identity from processing the IP address and other information in the log file.

Moreover, we use tracking pixel and analytics services when you visit our website. You will find more detailed explanations in this data protection information below.

##### <a name="3.">3. Data transfer </a>
If we forward personal data collected through websites to processors, we will notify you in this data protection information regarding the respective data processing operation, citing the specific recipient.

Aside from that, we will only forward your personal data if

-	you have given consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR;  
- this is required pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. b GDPR for the performance of a contract with you (for example forwarding to shipping companies for the purpose of delivering goods ordered by you, or forwarding payment information to payment service providers or credit institutions in order to process a payment transaction);  
- there is a legal obligation for disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR.

The recipients may use the transferred data for the above-mentioned purposes only.

##### <a name="4.">4. Cookies</a>
Cockies are not set.

##### <a name="5.">5. Web analysis/Tracking</a>
There is no web analysis/tracking.

##### <a name="6.">6. Social-Media-Plugins</a>
We use so-called social media buttons (also social media plugins) on our website. These are small buttons by means of which you can publish content from our website in social networks under your profile.

If you activate such a button, a connection is established between our website and the social network. In addition to the content in question, the operator of the social network receives further information, some of which is personal. This includes, for example, the fact that you are currently visiting our site.

The integration of the social media buttons is done using the so-called Shariff solution. This solution prevents a connection to a social network from being established simply because you call up a page with a social media button without activating it. This means that information is only transmitted to the social network when you activate the button.

We use the following social media plugins:

__a)	Facebook Ireland Limited: Sharing on Facebook__

In some cases, information is transmitted to the parent company Facebook Inc. based in the USA. This company observes the data protection provisions of the "US Privacy Shield" and is registered with the "US Privacy Shield" program of the US Department of Commerce.

The implementation is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR; our legitimate interest in this case is the smooth integration of the videos and the attractive design of our website.

The integration is done using a solution that prevents a connection to Google from being established just because you call up a page with an implemented video without activating the video. This means that information is only transmitted to YouTube when you click on the video to watch it.

__Information on your right to object pursuant to Article 21 GDPR__

You have the right to object, on grounds relating from your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data, which is based on point (e) of Article 6(1) GDPR (data processing for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest) and on point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR (data processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests); this is also applicable to profiling pursuant to Article 4(4) GDPR based on this regulation.

If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless processing serves the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

If your objection is directed against the processing of data for the purpose of direct marketing, we will stop the processing immediately. In this case, citing a special situation is not necessary. This is also applicable to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.

If you wish to make use of your right to object, please send an email to [datenschutzkoordination@zv.fraunhofer.de](mailto:datenschutzkoordination@zv.fraunhofer.de).

Besides, we use suitable technical and organisational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorised access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously being improved as the technology advances
